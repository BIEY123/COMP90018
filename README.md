README

1. The application is designed for Android device.

2. To use the application, please ensure your GPS signal is good. The application may quit when you start to track yourself if the GPS signal is not strong enough. The application can not work without GPS service.

3. When sending the SOS SMS, the location may be ‘testing’ instead of the precise location of the user. It is not a problem of the application, but rather a temporary problem of the location providers. If the location displayed as ‘testing’, please wait for a while or change your location to test again.
